Diabetic Prediction Project
Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that can predict diabetes in patients using a dataset from Kaggle. The model will be trained and evaluated using various machine learning techniques, and the results will be visualized on a user interface created using Streamlit.

Data
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle. It contains information on 768 patients, including their medical history and test results. The dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Methodology
Data preprocessing: The dataset will be cleaned and processed to handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset will be analyzed to understand the distribution of the features and their correlation with the target variable.

Model building: Different machine learning algorithms will be trained and evaluated to find the best model for prediction.

Evaluation: The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Visualization: The results will be visualized on a user interface created using Streamlit, allowing users to easily understand and interact with the information.
